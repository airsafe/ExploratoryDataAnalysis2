# Part 3 of Project 2 requires an output of a PNG plot using ggplot2 plotting system in R
#   that shows the total PM2.5 emission fromBaltimore City, Maryland (fips = "24510") by year
#   for the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. The graphic should compare the pollution from four types
#   of sources indicated by the type variable (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable in order
#   to see which of these four sources have seen decreases.

# Unique values in the NEI table are as follows:
# Column 1 is the county [fips] (3263)
# Column 2 is the SCC codes for the source (5,386), 
# Column 3 is the aggregate pollutant (1), 
# Column 4 is the emissions in tons (2,648,767),
# Column 5 the source type (4), and 
# Column 6 is the year (4)

# Can load the ggplot2 RStudio package, which allow easy comparison of subsets of a dataset.
# The basic plotting function is qplot where x-axis is years and y-axis cumulative emmissions
# Data will be the part of NEI that is both associated with Baltimore City 
#  where  observations are represented by geoms, or geometric objects, 
#  (in this case, geom_bar for bars), and where there is a statistical transformation (sum).
#  Another variable (column) in NEI can be used as an attribute that can be used to compare subsets of the data
#  In this case the variable 'type' had four categories, and the resulting graph was compared each of 
#  those four variations in a bar graph.

# Next step is to install ggplot2
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)


# First step was to get the data
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")

# Also need SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds") to map some data names to data codes
# Column 4 has pollutant values, and column 6 the year, so can do a split in combination with sapply 
# on the list created by split(NEI[4],NEI$year to get a sum by year


# Next step is to extract only those rows associated with Baltimore City, MD (fips == "24510")
##  Side note. The city of Baltimore is within Baltimore County, and the residents of the County
##  can be rather touchy if you confuse the two in their presence

NEI_bal_city <- NEI[NEI[,1]=="24510",]

# The following are equivalent
#   NEI_bal_city <- NEI[NEI$fips=="24510",]
#   NEI_bal_city <- NEI[NEI[,1]=="24510",] # Prefer this version because tolerates change in column name

# Can test for equivalence using all(NEI[NEI$fips=="24510",] == NEI[NEI[,1]=="24510",])
# For building the graph, used as reference http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Bar_and_line_graphs_(ggplot2)/
