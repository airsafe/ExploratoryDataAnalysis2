# Part 3 of Project 2 requires an output of a PNG plot using ggplot2 plotting system in R
#   that shows the total PM2.5 emission fromBaltimore City, Maryland (fips = "24510") by year
#   for the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. The graphic should compare the pollution from four types
#   of sources indicated by the type variable (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable in order
#   to see which of these four sources have seen decreases.

# First step was to get the data
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")

# Next step is to install ggplot2 in RStudio
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Also need SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds") to map some data names to data codes
# Column 4 has pollutant values, and column 6 the year, so can do a split in combination with sapply 
# on the list created by split(NEI[4],NEI$year to get a sum by year

# Next step is to extract only those rows associated with Baltimore City, MD (fips == "24510")

NEI_bal_city <- NEI[NEI[,1]=="24510",]

# Plot of data output to working directory in PNG format
par(mfrow=c(1,1)) # Ensure full sized graphic
png(file = "plot3.png", width = 480, height = 480) # Open PNG device to place output in working directory
